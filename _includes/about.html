        <p>Plug-and-Play Tutoring - Instant set up of a community service tutoring program at any college campus. Tutoring programs require a level of technical infrastructure, in particular:
- A mechanism for enrolling students
- A mechanism for undergrads/grads to apply to be tutors
- A mechanism to match tutors and students, once enrolled and admitted
- A calendar to track when tutoring sessions will occur </p>

      <div class="col-lg-4">
        <p>A good technical infrastructure would also include certain ‘luxuries’, including:
- Automated reminder emails to tutors and tutees based on the calendar
- A mechanism to collect basic analytics: most in-demand subjects, times, etc.
- A mechanism to collect feedback
- A mechanism to re-match tutors and tutees, on a semester to semester basis, based on said feedback

The idea of Plug-and-Play Tutoring/TutorPages is to provide a black box that requires only basic, surface-level inputs from the users and abstracts away all technical complexity, providing features like this as well as room to grow more and build up new capabilities.</p>
